This is a little experiment that visualizes the social graph of the Wikileaks
CableGate cable messages using the From and To metadata scraped from 
the message.

The station codes in stations.js file was scraped from a listing in:

    http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/canus-supp/A117_s1_066.pdf

If you want to run this yourself you'll need to obtain the cablegate
wikileak data, and run the fromto.py script which scrapes the html 
in the cable directory, and generates cablegate.js, which contains the 
graph information. For example:

  % fromto.py /path/to/cablegate-201012021401

Dependencies:
- python v2.6+
- easy_install python-graph-core
